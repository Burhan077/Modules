> [!NOTE]
> I'm not soldering wires together like some kind of animal ---
> thus PCBs designed in KiCad.
>
> And not only don't I solder wires, I like surface-mount
> components.  And not just because some newer stuff isn't
> even available in through-hole form any more.

> Everything is designed to be "hand-soldered" --- although
> your definition of hand-soldering may differ from mine. The
> boards are double-sided, but surface mount components are
> only on one side, typically with the other side used only
> for connectors and the like.
